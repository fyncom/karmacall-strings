    <!--    Would like to have the Cash in our name show our color like header_nav_bar_main.xml. Need to fix
        the linking at the end as well. See

    <string name="GDPR_Description">The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect on May 25, 2018 in the
        European Union. The GDPR applies to every company that processes EU citizens\' PII
        (Personally Identifiable Information). This new law prioritizes the importance of the
        protection and privacy of your personal information in several key areas. The state of
        California recently passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). All the rights of
        CCPA are met by complying with the GDPR which KarmaCall does, as described below.
        \n\nFirst, KarmaCall provides the ability to consent to data collection in an easily accessible
        format. At KarmaCall, we store your personal contact information – phone number, digital wallet,
        as well as data concerned with our performance of contract which in part captures digital
        wallet transactions for anti-spam purposes and length of your call times for improving our
        services. Along with your basic contact information, we use Flurry Analytics to track how you
        use our application so we can learn how to improve it to make your experience as enjoyable as
        possible. Any other data which is VOLUNTARILY provided by you (demographics and
        psychographics), but is not required for our spam-blocking features, will be stored as well.
        \n\nSecond, KarmaCall supplies the opportunity to request your data. We display the data
        currently held under your user and/or business entity in a user-friendly format.
        KarmaCall does not sell or provide your data to any 3rd party sources for any reason.
        \n\nThird, KarmaCall presents the option to have all data we have collected, deleted on request.
        If you make this request, we will comply without undue delay except as required by other
        laws. For example, some financial data may not be deleted if it is required for tax records.
